#GIFs En Espa√±ol

This is a Node-powered Twitter bot (@GifsEnEspanol) that
runs on a Raspberry Pi. There's nothing about the code
that's actually specific to a Raspberry Pi, it's just
a little fun fact.

The bot listens for tweets from @gifsinwords, and replies
back to them with Spanish translations, for no particular
reason other that it was something fun to do.

##Setup

- TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY
